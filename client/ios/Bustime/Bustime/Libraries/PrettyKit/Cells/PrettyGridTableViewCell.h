/** `PrettyGridTableViewCell` is a `PrettyCustomTableViewCell` customization
 that creates and manages several elements inside the same cell, displayed as a
 grid. 
  
 First of all, change numberOfElements property to match your needs. Then, call 
 setText:atIndex: for each element. You can also set detail texts with
 setDetailText:atIndex:.
 
 Finally, to receive a notification when an element is selected, change the
 actionBlock property.
 
 
 ### Customization

 #### Labels
 
 It currently presents a text label and a detailText label. All displayed 
 information, except the text alignment, is obtained from the properties 
 textLabel and detailTextLabel, inherited from `UITableViewCell` class. Text
 Alignment should be customized through the `textAlignment` property.
 
 Take into account that `textLabel` and `detailTextLabel` may change dpending on the
 cell's style. For example, if the cell's style is `UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle`,
 `detailTextLabel.textColor` would be gray, but if the style is `UITableViewCellStyleValue1`,
 the color would be blue.
 
 You can change the texts or detail texts of a given index through setText:atIndex:, 
 textAtIndex:, setDetailText:AtIndex:, detailTextAtIndex:.
 
 #### Selection
 
 You can enable or disable selection highlighting. set elementSelectionStyle to
 `UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone` to disable highlighting, or any other 
 value to enable it. Use `selectionGradientStartColor` and `selectionGradientEndColor`
 properties from `PrettyTableViewCell` to change the gradient appearance. 
 
 You can manually select a given index through selectIndex:. You can 
 manually deselect the currently selected index through deselectAnimated:.

 You can get notified when an element is selected by setting the `actionBlock`
 property to your needs.
 
 ### Performance
 
 This cell is entirely drawn with CoreGraphics, so you will have a nice scrolling
 performance.
 
 ### Example
 
 ![](../docs/Screenshots/grid.png)
 
    [gridCell setText:@"One" atIndex:0];
    [gridCell setDetailText:@"Detail Text" atIndex:0];
    [gridCell setText:@"Two" atIndex:1];            
    [gridCell setDetailText:@"Detail Text" atIndex:1];
    [gridCell setText:@"Three" atIndex:2];
    [gridCell setDetailText:@"Detail Text" atIndex:2];
